# About

<img src="updated_logo.png" align="right" width="142"/>

ASySD was developed in the [CAMARADES](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences/research/camarades/about-camarades) research group at the University of Edinburgh by Kaitlyn Hair. Lukas Wallrich and the CiteSource team have also contributed significantly to ASySD, enabling the development of new features, improvements, and use cases. ASySD is actively maintained and enhanced as both an R package and a Shiny application, with ongoing development hosted on GitHub.

# Performance

By comparing metadata fields in existing in-house systematic search datasets, rule-based match criteria were iteratively developed to identify duplicate citations with a high degree of accuracy. Once developed, ASySD was evaluated on 5 unseen biomedical systematic review datasets of varying sizes (\~1800 to \~80,000 citations). Using ASySD's automated deduplication approach was highly sensitive, capturing over 95% of citations, and highly specific with a very low false positive rate of \<0.2%.


# Packages ASySD uses

The data import functionality within ASySD uses the [**synthesisr**](https://github.com/mjwestgate/synthesisr) package, created by Martin Westgate, the [**RefManageR**](https://docs.ropensci.org/RefManageR/authors.html#citation) package, created by Mathew W. McLean, and the [**Bibliometix**](https://github.com/massimoaria/bibliometrix) package by Massimo Aria & Corrado Cuccurullo. The record matching function underlying this tool uses the [**RecordLinkage**](https://rdrr.io/cran/RecordLinkage/) package, created by Murat Sariyar and Andreas Borg.
