AB  - Several studies have highlighted the essential role of taurine in maintaining the health of small animals, particularly dogs. Taurine deficiency has been linked to various health issues, especially in certain dog breeds. Therefore, accurately assessing taurine levels in canine blood is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring these conditions. In this study, we present the development of a novel liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for rapidly quantifying taurine concentrations in dog whole blood and plasma. The method was validated according to current guidelines, showing excellent accuracy, precision, and sensitivity across a wide concentration range. Specifically, the limit of quantification was set at 80 nmol/mL for whole blood and 8 nmol/mL for plasma, ensuring the method’s reliability for both matrices. The application of this validated technique to blood samples of healthy dogs allowed for the establishment of reference intervals for taurine concentrations (148 to 495 nmol/mL for whole blood; 42 to 183 nmol/mL for plasma). Due to its robustness and simplicity, this method represents a valuable tool, supporting its routine use in health assessments and enabling more effective monitoring of taurine status in dogs. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To determine the association between ionized calcium (iCa) and/or total magnesium (tMg) and the development of sepsis and to investigate whether iCa or tMg is associated with mortality in puppies with canine parvoviral enteritis (CPE). METHODS 64 client-owned puppies with CPE were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Serum iCa and tMg were measured daily from admission until death or discharge. Fifteen healthy client-owned puppies were used as controls. RESULTS Mean iCa concentrations of the CPE group on admission were significantly lower compared to the control group (1.35 mmol/L vs 1.52 mmol/L). Ionized calcium concentrations of nonsurvivors were significantly higher compared to survivors on day 2 but not on any other days. Puppies that were hypercalcemic on day 2 were also significantly more likely to die than normocalcemic puppies (OR, 10.7; 95% CI, 1.7 to 71). Ionized calcium was not associated with the development of sepsis on any day. In contrast, mean admission tMg concentrations of the CPE group were significantly higher compared to the control group (0.72 mmol/L vs 0.63 mmol/L). However, tMg concentrations were not significantly different between survivors and nonsurvivors nor were they associated with the development of sepsis on any day. CONCLUSIONS On admission, puppies with CPE had lower iCa and higher tMg compared to healthy puppies, and higher iCa a day after initiation of treatment was associated with increased odds of mortality. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The results of this study provide insight into calcium homeostasis in critically ill young dogs with CPE. © 2025 THE AUTHORS.

AB  - Color varies in pattern and degree across the tree of life. In animals, genetic variation in color is hypothesized to have pleiotropic effects on a variety of behaviors due to shared dependence on underlying biochemical pathways. Such pleiotropy can constrain the independent evolution of color and behavior. Although associations between color and behavior have been reported, this relationship has not yet been addressed across a broad taxonomic scale with a formal meta-analysis. We used a phylogenetic meta-analytic approach to examine the relationship between individual variation in aggressive behavior and variation in multiple colors. Seventy-four studies met our inclusion criteria (vertebrates = 70; invertebrates = 4). After accounting for phylogeny and correcting for publication bias, there was a positive association between measures of aggression and degree or area of coloration (mean = 0.248, 95% CI = (0.044, 0.477)). Because this positive association was not restricted to melanin-based coloration, we conclude that this pattern does not strongly support the melanin pleiotropy hypothesis. Because the association was also not affected by moderators accounting for individual condition, social rank, or age, the results do not strongly support hypotheses that condition dependence accounts for relationships between color and aggressive behavior. The badge of status hypothesis predicts that arbitrary traits can evolve to signal aggression or social dominance. We propose that this is the most parsimonious explanation for the patterns we observe. Because of the lack of evidence for condition dependence in the association between color and aggression, we further propose that the genetic covariation between traits contributes to the evolution of the badges of status. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - A complete assessment of animal welfare requires not just an understanding of negative emotional states, such as fear and anxiety, but also of positive states, such as calmness and happiness. However, few studies have identified accurate and reliable indicators of positive emotional states in dogs. This study aimed to identify parameters that may serve as indicators of short-term emotional states in dogs. Using a cross-over design, 60 dogs living at a research facility were exposed to six different 10-min scenarios expected to elicit responses varying in emotional valence and arousal. A range of behavioural and physiological parameters were collected and their relationship to anticipated emotional valence and arousal was analysed using linear and logistic mixed models. Cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, heart rate variability, panting, whining, and body shake all demonstrated significant differences based on arousal levels, but only within negative valence scenarios. Scores from a qualitative behavioural assessment (QBA) were associated with both emotional valence and arousal and were considered the best indicator of positive valence. Activity, ear temperature, and sitting were associated with positive high arousal, although this may have been influenced by differing levels of movement induced during these scenarios. Meanwhile, heart rate, secretory immunoglobulin A, standing and lying all showed similar changes associated with arousal for both positive and negative valence scenarios. This study provides a critical first step towards identifying evidence-based indicators of short-term emotional states in dogs, while highlighting considerations that should be made when employing these parameters, including the influence of coder bias, food provision, exercise, and external temperature. Overall, it is recommended future dog emotion and welfare research use a combination of parameters including indicators of both emotional valence and arousal. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is an important cause of disease and death in humans and dogs, and although wildlife infections are common, less is known about disease manifestations. A 12-week-old male American black bear (Ursus americanus) cub with mild lethargy and anorexia presented to a wildlife rehabilitation center in Lake Tahoe, California. The cub continued to become increasingly weak and showed decreasing interest in play and other activities. The cub was anemic and had increased γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) liver enzymes. A large number of trypanosomes were noted on a thin blood smear. Trypanosoma cruzi was isolated in culture from a subsequent blood collection. Proliferative bony lesions were noted on radiographs, but this finding was considered unrelated to the T. cruzi infection. The number of parasites observed in thin blood smears dramatically dropped over time, but it remained PCR positive until at least nine months. The cub continued to gain weight and became increasingly active. Serum samples from the cub were positive with three different serologic assays (IFA, ELISA, and ICT). The bear was not treated because of the decreasing parasitemia and the improvement in activity and appetite. Although the bear could not be released due to issues unrelated to T. cruzi, it remains healthy in a captive facility. Sequence analysis of the DHFR-TS and COII-ND1 gene sequences confirmed the bear was infected with DTC TcIV. Following the detection of this clinical case, a serologic survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of T. cruzi exposure of black bears in California, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Because no serologic assay has been validated for use in bears, three different assays were used. Marked differences in apparent seroprevalence range from 1% (requiring all three assays to be positive) to ∼20.7% (requiring only one assay to be positive). Black bears are naturally exposed to T. cruzi across the United States. Future studies using PCR testing of tissues or blood would be needed to better understand the prevalence of T. cruzi in wild black bears, lineages most commonly associated with infection, and if T. cruzi represents a health threat to bears. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of radiographs in identifying humeral intracondylar fissures in dogs. Materials and Methods: Clinical data from dogs undergoing CT and radiographic elbow investigations at a single institution were reviewed. Based on CT diagnosis, radiographs were classified as having fissures and not having fissures. The radiographic images were evaluated by three blinded observers for the presence/absence of a fissure, type (partial or complete), and for secondary signs that could suggest the presence of a fissure in case this was not visible. Results: A total of 81 radiographs (76 elbows) were reviewed. Based on CT findings, 37 elbows had fissures and 44 did not. Radiographic interpretation demonstrated a sensitivity of 47.7% (confidence interval 95%: 0.40 to 0.59) and specificity of 85.6% (confidence interval 95%: 0.72 to 0.93) in correctly identifying humeral intracondylar fissures. The positive predictive value was 75.5% (confidence interval 95%: 0.64 to 0.84) and the negative predictive value was 66.1% (confidence interval 95%: 0.63 to 0.68). Agreement with CT images was <0.4, and interobserver and intraobserver agreements were <0.8. The radiographic orientation and type of fissure did not significantly affect interpretation outcomes. Clinical Significance: Radiographic imaging alone is insufficient for reliably diagnosing humeral intracondylar fissures in dogs. © 2024 British Small Animal Veterinary Association.

AB  - Myotonia congenita is a hereditary, non-dystrophic skeletal muscle disorder associated with muscle stiffness due to delayed muscle relaxation after contraction. We review myotonia congenita in domesticated animals and humans and investigated suspected myotonia congenita in a flock of Merino sheep in Australia. In 2020, a property in New South Wales reported a four-year history of lambs that would fall on disturbance before rapidly recovering, with 13 affected sheep identified in 2020. Episodes were associated with a short period of tetanic spasms and a stiff gait upon rising. Lambs were otherwise normal between episodes, although over time, lost body condition and occasionally died from misadventure. An inherited condition was considered from limited pedigree information and a preliminary diagnosis of myotonia congenita was made based on clinical presentation. Biochemistry from four sheep found variable, but typically mild increases in creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Modified electromyography on six affected sheep found irregular electrical activity within the muscle. For four sheep, there were no consistent significant abnormalities on post mortem examination and histopathology—typical for this condition. A review of the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA) databases was conducted to summarise information about myotonia congenita in humans and eight non-human species of animals. Comparing the characteristic clinical presentation, pathology and electromyography data of affected Merino sheep to similar conditions in other species assisted the identification of likely candidate genes. Whole genome sequencing of two affected lambs detected a missense variant in CLCN1 (NC_056057.1:g.107930611C>T; XM_004008136.5:c.844C>T; XP_004008185.4:p.(P282S)), with a predicted deleterious effect on protein function. An SNP genotyping assay was developed, and the variant segregated with the disease in 12 affected sheep and obligate carrier rams under an assumed recessive mode of inheritance. Identifying a likely causal variant and developing a diagnostic test allows screening of suspected affected or carrier Merino sheep for early intervention to reduce propagation of the variant within flocks. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The present study was conducted at Veterinary Clinical Complex of NTR College of Veterinary Science, Gannavaram, from March to November 2023,found a hospital prevalence of hypothyroidism at 0.45% (27/5957). Ten hypothyroid dogs (Group II) treated with Levothyroxine (0.02 mg/kg daily) had significantly (p<0.01) lower pre therapeutic mean TT4 (8.42±1.15 nmol/L) and FT4 (0.37±0.09 ng/dL) levels compared to healthy controls (Group I), with significant (p≤0.01)improvement after therapy. Haemato-biochemical analysis revealed significant increase (p<0.05) in haemoglobin, PCV and TEC, along with significant (p<0.05)decline in ALP, cholesterol and triglyceride levels after therapy, emphasizing the importance of levothyroxinein canine hypothyroidism. © 2024 Indian Veterinary Assocaition.

AB  - Introduction: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has surfaced as a critical challenge to public health on a global scale. The precise and swift identification of resistance to antimicrobial agents, along with timely and suitable antimicrobial therapy paired with effective stewardship practices, is crucial for managing the rise and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. The objective of our investigation was to outline the antimicrobial resistance profile of Staphylococcus spp., a significant contributor to canine otitis, a prevalent condition in dogs, isolated in Western Romania. Methods and Materials: All data were collected from clinical cases of canine otitis externa which presented at the University Clinic of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Timișoara/Romania. A clinical evaluation was conducted, from which era swabs are usually collected and sent for analysis at the laboratory. Laboratory analysis included the microbiological examination for identifying Staphylococcus spp. and determining antibiotic susceptibility phenotypes. Statistical analysis was implemented on all data that were collected. The ear swabs were processed with standard procedures for cultivating and identifying bacteria. The resulting subcultures were processed to determine the staphylococcal species on the GP ID Cards of the Vitek® 2 automatic system. The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were detected by the Vitek® 2 system using an AST-GP80 card. These isolated Staphylococcus spp. strains were further processed by real-time PCR and PCR-RFLP. Results: Of all the auricular exudate samples analyzed, 76 were positive for Staphylococcus spp. (59.38%). Within these, in 82% of auricular samples, six distinct Staphylococcus spp. were identified (Staphylococcus (S.) pseudintermedius, S. intermedius, S. hyicus, S. delphiny, S. shleiferi, and S. aureus). Our data indicate that the PCR-RFLP assay is a practical approach to S. pseudintermedius identification, allowing for discrimination from the other Staphylococcus Intermedius Group (SIG) species and important staphylococcal pathogens of dogs. The highest frequency of resistant S. pseudintermedius isolates was detected against tetracycline (21/34; 61.76%; p-value 0.003), gentamicin (20/34; 58.82%), and kanamycin (20/34; 58.82%). Conclusions: These results are essential to guide the prudent use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine. They will also help design efficient control strategies and measure their effectiveness. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The purpose of this review is to examine the current scientific literature regarding the interplay between the exocrine and endocrine pancreas, specifically the role of the exocrine pancreas in the pathogenesis of canine diabetes mellitus. β-cell death caused by exocrine pancreatic inflammation is thought to be an under-recognised contributor to diabetes mellitus in dogs, with up to 30 % of canine diabetic patients with concurrent evidence of pancreatitis at post-mortem examination. Current diagnostics for pancreatitis are imprecise, and treatments for both diseases individually have their own limitations: diabetes through daily insulin injections, which has both welfare and financial implications for the stakeholders, and pancreatitis through treatment of clinical signs, such as analgesia and anti-emetics, rather than targeted treatment of the underlying cause. This review will consider the evidence for exocrine pancreatic inflammation making an active contribution to pancreatic β-cell loss and insulin-deficiency diabetes in the dog and explore current and potential future diagnostic and treatment avenues to improve outcomes for these patients. © 2024 The Authors
