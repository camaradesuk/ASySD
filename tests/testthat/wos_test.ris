AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the blood supply to the humeral condyle of dogs and compare the blood supply of Cocker Spaniel dogs to non-Cocker Spaniel dogs. We hypothesize that there is a congenitally altered blood supply of the humeral condyle in some Cocker Spaniels when compared to the blood supply of the humeral condyle in other breeds of dogs, which leads to abnormal ossification between the medial and lateral aspects of the humeral condyle, and predisposes them to fracture and delayed healing.
   Microangiography was performed on four Cocker Spaniel and four non-Cocker Spaniel dogs of similar size and weight. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the microangiographs of the humeral condyles revealed a decreased vascular density in the medial, midcondylar and lateral aspects of the condyle in the Cocker Spaniel dogs compared to the non-Cocker Spaniel dogs. This decreased vascular density may play a role in the increased incidence of humeral condylar fractures in the adult Cocker Spaniel dog without any or only minor trauma, and in the delayed healing seen in association with these fractures.

AB  - Generalized progressive retinal atrophy (GPRA) is a common disease in Cocker Spaniels dogs characterized by progressive loss of retinal function and disappearance of photoreceptors. The disease is bilateral, hereditary, autosomal recessive, has no sexual predisposition and is frequently associated with cataracts. According to molecular studies the degeneration occurs by a mutation in different genes. In American Cocker Spaniels dogs the disease is observed between three and five years of age and in English Cocker Spaniels between four and eight years old. The clinical signs are: nyctalopia, tapetal hyperreflexia and cataracts. The diagnosis is based on clinical history, ophthalmologic examination and complementary exams such as electroretinography, ocular ultrasound and genetic testing. This article aimed to conduct a review of literature on the generalized progressive retinal atrophy (GPRA) in Cocker Spaniel dogs with cataracts.

AB  - Background: American Cocker Spaniels are overrepresented among breeds that require surgery as a treatment of end-stage otitis externa. However, the prevalence of otitis externa (OE) in this breed remains unknown. We reviewed the year 2010 medical records of 55 private veterinary clinics in Finland to determine the prevalence of OE in American Cocker Spaniels compared with English Cocker and English and Welsh Springer Spaniels. An American Cocker Spaniel owner questionnaire was designed to identify potential risk factors for end-stage OE.
   Results: From the medical records of 98,736 dogs, the prevalence of OE was highest in Welsh Springer Spaniels (149 out of 468, 31.8%, [95% confidence interval 27.6-36.0]), followed by American Cocker (89/329, 27.0%, [22.2-31.7]), English Springer (96/491, 19.6%, [16.1-23.1]) and English Cocker Spaniels (231/1467, 15.7%, [13.8-17.6]). The mean number of OE episodes in ear-diseased dogs and the number of ear surgeries were highest in American Cocker Spaniels. Owner questionnaires were received for 151 American Cocker Spaniels, 85 (56%) of which had suffered from OE. In 47% (40/85) of these dogs, OE occurred without concurrent skin lesions, 46% (33/72) displayed the first signs of OE before 1 year of age. In 24% (20/85) of the dogs, the signs of OE recurred within 1 month or continued despite treatment, 16% (14/85) required surgery (n = 11) or were euthanized (n = 5; 2 of the operated dogs and 3 others) due to severe OE. The onset of OE before the age of 1 year significantly increased the risk (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.1-13.6) of end-stage OE.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of OE in American Cocker Spaniels in Finland was higher than previously reported in Cocker Spaniels, but the highest prevalence of OE was found in Welsh Springer Spaniels. Compared to the other Spaniels, OE was more often recurrent and more frequently surgically managed in American Cocker Spaniels. Based on the questionnaire, early onset (< 1 year) of OE increased the risk of end-stage OE. In American Cocker Spaniels, OE requires an intensive approach from the first treatment, and prevention of recurrence should be emphasised. The causes and treatment of OE in this breed warrant further study.

AB  - A neurodegenerative storage disease identified as ceroid-lipofuscinosis by light, fluorescence, and electron microscopic examinations was diagnosed in a 4-year-old female Cocker Spaniel dog with progressive ataxia and proprioceptive deficits. Stored pigment was found within neurons of the brain and spinal cord and in smooth muscle cells of the urinary bladder and small muscular arteries. The microscopic findings resembled those found in six other cases of generalized ceroid-lipofuscinosis in this breed. However, the brown discoloration of the intestines, which was the major gross lesion observed in those cases, was not found. This is the first report of the disease in Argentina.

AB  - A retrospective study of eight young Cocker Spaniels aged 9-24 months was performed to describe the ultrasonographic findings of histologically confirmed renal dysplasia. Ultrasonography revealed kidneys of significantly (p < 0.001) reduced volume in all dogs. During qualitative evaluation, two different types of sonographic alterations could be seen. In one type of the ultrasound alterations, corticomedullary demarcation was distinct and the renal cortex was remarkably thin, which was best seen in the dorsal (frontal) imaging plane. In the other type of the ultrasound appearance, overall increased echogenicity with poor corticomedullary demarcation was noticed, and the kidneys could hardly be separated from their surroundings. These features were best recognised in the sagittal (coronal) imaging plane. In one dog with secondary hypercalcaemia, a hyperechoic corticomedullary area was also seen. Post-mortem histological diagnosis revealed renal dysplasia and secondary fibrosis. Based on ultrasound findings alone, renal dysplasia (renal familial disease) can be suspected when small kidneys with thin echogenic cortex are present in young dogs. An ultrasound image, similar to that of fibrotic kidneys (increased overall echogenicity and reduced corticomedullary definition) cannot be differentiated from chronic inflammatory disease and from endstage kidneys. Therefore, ultrasound-guided biopsy or post-mortem histology is necessary for the definitive diagnosis of renal dysplasia. This is the first study reporting on the ultrasound appearance of renal dysplasia in Cocker Spaniel dogs.

AB  - A high percentage of aggression problems and a tendency to display noninhibited aggression in the English cocker spaniel (ECS) have been suggested by many authors. The authors of this paper designed a retrospective study to analyze the aggressive behavior of 145 ECSs presented for aggression problems to the Animal Behavior Service at the Barcelona School of Veterinary Medicine's veterinary teaching hospital. Aggressive ECSs were compared with a population of dogs of the same breed presented for a behavior problem other than aggression and with a population of aggressive dogs of other breeds. The most common forms of aggression in the ECS were owner-directed aggression (67.6%), aggression toward unfamiliar people (18.4%), aggression toward unfamiliar dogs (10.1%), and aggression toward family dogs (3.3%). Owner-directed aggression was more common in the ECS than in other breeds, although in similar contexts. In the ECS, the golden coat color was more common in the aggressive dogs than in nonaggressive dogs. ECSs showed impulsive aggression more frequently than aggressive dogs of other breeds. The aim of the study was to analyze cases of aggressive ECSs seen in a referral practice. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Anal sac gland carcinomas occur frequently in English Cocker Spaniels and, to a lesser extent, in other spaniel breeds. The disease typically presents in dogs aged 8 years or older and frequently metastasises to the local lymph nodes. The association between anal sac gland carcinoma in English Cocker Spaniels and the major histocompatibility complex class II loci (the dog leukocyte antigen loci DLA-DRB1, -DQA1, -DQB1) was investigated in 42 cases and 75 controls. Based on a corrected error rate of 0.017 for each test, the allele distribution in DLA-DRB1 showed no significant difference between cases and controls (Pvalue = 0.019), while a significant difference was obtained for DLA-DQA1 and -DQB1 alleles (P values are 0.010 and 3.3 x 10-5). The DLA-DQB1*00701 allele was the most common in both cases and controls, but it had a higher frequency among the former (0.89) than in the latter (0.61), while the second most common allele had a higher frequency in the controls (0.23) than in the cases (0.07). Haplotype distributions were also significantly different between the two groups (Pvalue = 1.61 x 10-4). This is the second disease in English Cocker Spaniels for which the most common DLA-DQB1 allele in the breed has been shown to have a higher frequency in cases than controls, while the second most common allele in the breed (*02001) has a significantly higher frequency in the controls, compared with the cases.

AB  - ObjectiveTo detect antibodies for lens H-crystallins in the serum from the American Cocker Spaniel (ACS) presenting with and without cataracts and with and without uveitis.
   Animal StudiedSeventy-three American Cocker Spaniels and six normal Beagles.
   ProceduresSera were collected from 73 ACSs, including those with normal lenses and those with cataracts, or uveitis. Fractionated, normal Beagle lens H-crystallins were separated by one- or two-dimensional electrophoresis. The separated lens H-crystallins were used on immunoblots as sentinel substrates against which the ACS sera were tested for the presence of antibodies against H-crystallins.
   ResultsSera from approximately two-thirds of study animals contained antibodies to some H-crystallin polypeptides, but reactivity varied among patients. Contrary to some hypotheses, serum antibodies to groups of H-crystallins did not relate to the stages of cataract. However, detailed analysis by two-dimensional immunoblotting and mass spectrometry showed that three spots originating from A1-crystallin were detected only in sera from cataract patients.
   ConclusionSerum antibodies to A1-crystallin may be associated with the development of cataract.

AB  - Objective Two pedigrees from the German English Cocker Spaniel population are presented to illustrate the familial occurrence of primary cataract (CAT) in single- and multicolored English Cocker Spaniels. The aim was to characterize similarities and differences in the prevalence and formation of CAT in these separately bred color variants of English Cocker Spaniels.
   Materials The study was based on the veterinary records for presumed inherited eye diseases of 1232 English Cocker Spaniels which were provided by the German panel of the European Eye Scheme for diagnosis of inherited eye diseases in animals (DOK, < http://www.dok-vet.de >). Data included information on 615 single-colored and 617 multicolored English Cocker Spaniels.
   Results CAT was diagnosed in 92 (14.96%) of the single-colored and 34 (5.51%) of the multicolored English Cocker Spaniels. The pedigree of the single-colored English Cocker Spaniels included 40 ophthalmologically examined dogs with 18 unaffected and 22 affected dogs. The pedigree of the multicolored English Cocker Spaniels contained 16 ophthalmologically examined dogs with 11 unaffected and five affected dogs.
   Conclusions In both color variants of the English Cocker Spaniels different forms of primary CAT with respect to location within the lens occurred among close relatives. Appearance of CAT was very heterogeneous without obvious sex differences. The sample pedigrees do not support the assumption of familial segregation of specific forms of primary CAT in English Cocker Spaniels.

AB  - BackgroundChronic pancreatitis (CP) is common in English cocker spaniels (ECS). It is histologically similar to IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) in humans and is characterized by duct destruction, interlobular fibrosis, and dense periductular and perivenous lymphocytic aggregates. However, the clinical manifestations of CP in ECS have not been previously described.ObjectivesCharacterize the clinical manifestations of CP in a group of ECS, including similarities and differences to IgG4-RD in humans.AnimalsOne-hundred four ECS with CP and 44 client owned control ECS without CP (both healthy and diseased controls).MethodsAffected dogs were divided into 2 groups according to the methods used to diagnose CP. Case records were searched for signalment, clinical, and clinicopathological findings, and evidence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), proteinuria, other immune-mediated diseases, and anal sacculitis.ResultsInvolvement of other organs was common. Affected ECS presented with a high frequency of KCS (n = 49), proteinuria (n = 47), anal gland disease (n = 36), atopy (n = 21), and other immune-mediated diseases (n = 16). Those with parti-color hair coats, particularly blue roan, had a strong association with CP, suggesting a link between coat color and autoimmune conditions in this breed.Conclusions and Clinical ImportanceEnglish cocker spaniels with CP show clinical similarities to humans with IgG4-RD and common involvement of other organs. Clinicians should evaluate affected Cocker Spaniels for proteinuria, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and other potential immune-mediated diseases.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not body weight is a risk factor for humeral condylar fractures (HCF), cranial cruciate rupture (CCR) or intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) in the American Cocker Spaniel dog. Body weight, age, sex and recorded diagnoses of 854 Cocker Spaniels admitted to the teaching hospital, over a four-year period, were recorded from medical records. Dogs with a diagnosis of HCF (n = 21) weighed significantly more than the general population of Cocker Spaniels seen at the hospital over the same time period. Dogs with CCR (n = 20) were likely to weigh more than the general population. Whereas, dogs with IVDD (n = 47) weighed less than the general population of Cocker Spaniels. From these results, we concluded that body weight is a predisposing factor for HCF in Cocker Spaniels: that there is a tendency for Cocker Spaniels with CCR to be heavier than the general population and that being overweight does not predispose them to IVDD.

AB  - Information on the behavior of both aggressive and nonaggressive (control) English cocker spaniels (ECS) recruited for genetic analysis is presented. Information from a total of 122 dogs was gathered using questionnaires and owner interviews, resulting in analysis of 52 aggressive (5 aggressive dogs were excluded from the analysis) and 65 control dogs. Owners rated their dogs with 5-point frequency scales for unacceptable behavior toward humans (17 items), fear (20 items), barking (8 items), and aggression toward other dogs (4 items). The results show that serious, repeated growling is the most pronounced single behavior characterizing the aggressive ECS, and this seems to be the most important behavior causing owners to classify their dogs as aggressive. The other main behavior characteristic of the aggressive group was skin-penetrating bites. Snapping and "biting in general" were also frequently reported among these dogs. The objective of this study was to describe some behavioral characteristics of ECS showing owner-defined aggressive behavior, and behavioral differences between these dogs and a group of ECS with excellent behavior.

AB  - The molecular background of hereditary nephropathies in English Cocker Spaniels and Springer Spaniels remained unclear until the beginning of the 21st century. It was only the discovery of an association between these diseases and Alport syndrome in humans that made it possible to identify the genes potentially responsible for nephropathies in dogs. Eventually, two mutations were identified in the COL4A4 gene coding for the alpha chains of collagen IV, the main component of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). This review presents the molecular mechanism resulting from the aforementioned mutations, the signs of disease, functions of the GBM, and breeding aspects.

AB  - Background Lobular dissecting hepatitis (LDH) is a rare form of canine liver cirrhosis that may be accompanied by portal hypertension in American Cocker Spaniels. In human patients with liver cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a common complication. However, PVT has not been reported in dogs with LDH. Herein, we describe the long-term follow-up of PVT in an American Cocker Spaniel with LDH. Case presentation An 8-year-old neutered male American Cocker Spaniel presented with a 1-month history of severe abdominal effusion. The dog was histopathologically diagnosed with LDH and treated with low-dose prednisolone on day 14. On day 115, computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the portal vein. Therefore, the dog was subcutaneously administered with the anticoagulant dalteparin, and low-dose prednisolone was continued. As a follow-up for PVT, CTA examinations were performed on days 207, 515, 886, and 1168, and the dog's antithrombin and D-dimer levels were measured. Following anticoagulant therapy, the dog was confirmed to have gradually increased antithrombin activity and decreased D-dimer concentrations. In addition, although the thrombus was confirmed to be in the same area of the portal vein system by CTA, atrophy and increased CT values due to organization were observed during the follow-up period. The dog's condition remained stable without clinical signs until day 1112 when it developed hepatic encephalopathy. The dog died on day 1208. On postmortem examination, histopathologically, the liver showed marked bile duct hyperplasia and fibrosis with chronic thrombus in the portal vein. Conclusions This case demonstrated that low-dose glucocorticoid combined with dalteparin allowed long-term follow-up of PVT in an American Cocker Spaniel with LDH.

AB  - Aggression is one of the most common behavioral problems in dogs and may have important negative effects on public health, human animal bond, and animal welfare. There is ample evidence showing a negative correlation between serum serotonin concentration and aggressive behavior in a variety of species, including the domestic dogs. This negative correlation is particularly pronounced in dogs that show impulsive aggression. Data obtained in some previous studies suggest that the English cocker spaniel (ECS) is more likely to show impulsive aggression than other breeds. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze possible differences in serum serotonin levels between aggressive ECS and aggressive dogs of other breeds. Nineteen ECSs presented for aggression at the Animal Behavior Service (School of Veterinary Science, Barcelona, Spain) were evaluated and compared with 20 aggressive dogs of other breeds attended at the same center. Serum serotonin levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS 15.0 for Windows. Aggressive ECSs had significantly (P < 0.001) lower levels of serum serotonin than aggressive dogs of other breeds (318.6 +/- 67.1 and 852.77 +/- 100.58 ng/mL, respectively). Variances were not significantly different between ECSs and other breeds (standard deviation = 449.84 ng/mL vs. 292.47 ng/mL, P > 0.05). This finding may explain why ECSs are more likely to show impulsive aggression than other breeds, and suggests that the ECS could be a good model to study the neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying impulsive aggression.

AB  - Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a common disease in the English cocker spaniel (ECS) and is characterized histologically by duct destruction, interlobular fibrosis and dense periductular and perivenous lymphocytic aggregates. These features are also found in human autoimmune pancreatitis type 1, part of a glucocorticoid-responsive, multiorgan syndrome, newly recognized as IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Human IgG4-RD affects one or several organs, often showing a predominance of IgG4(+) plasma cells histologically, with an IgG4(+) :total IgG(+) plasma cell ratio of >40%. This study investigated whether ECSs with CP and/or inflammatory disease in several organs show an increase in IgG4(+) plasma cells within affected tissues. Histological sections of pancreas, liver, kidney, salivary gland and conjunctiva were obtained from ECSs with idiopathic chronic inflammatory disease affecting those tissues. Tissue samples from age-matched dogs of other breeds with similar diseases were also sampled. Control diseased tissue samples, from dogs without a suspected immune-mediated disease, were included. A subset of ECSs and dogs of other breeds presented with disease in more than one organ. Immunohistochemistry was performed with primary reagents detecting total IgG and three of the four canine IgG subclasses (IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4). Normal sections of pancreas and liver showed an absence of labelled plasma cells of any subclass. Normal kidney and salivary gland sections showed the presence of a few labelled plasma cells (<10 plasma cells/high-power field). Fourteen tissue sections from 12 ECSs and seven sections from six dogs of other breeds showed elevated numbers of IgG4(+) plasma cells and IgG4(+):IgG(+) ratios >40%. Individual dogs (ECSs and other breeds) showed marked increases in IgG4(+) cells. There were no significant differences in the number of IgG4(+) plasma cells between ECSs and dogs of other breeds for affected pancreas, liver, salivary glands and conjunctiva. Kidney sections had more IgG4(+) cells, for both ECSs and dogs of other breeds, than did sections from other organs. Dogs of other breeds had significantly more IgG4(+) plasma cells in affected kidneys than ECSs. In conclusion, several ECSs and dogs of other breeds fulfilled the histological criteria for the diagnosis of IgG4-RD, supporting the existence of a multiorgan immune-mediated disease in ECSs and some dogs of other breeds.

AB  - American Cocker Spaniels (ACSs) develop aural ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia more often than dogs of other breeds. Data on the cause and development of these breed characteristic histopathological changes are lacking. We performed video-otoscopic examinations and dermatological work-up on 28 ACSs, obtained aural biopsies from each dog and assessed the statistical associations between the presence of ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia and disease history, clinical or microbiological findings and underlying cause of otitis externa (OE). Histological lesions of ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia were observed in aural biopsies from 6/13 clinically healthy ears and 13/15 ears with OE from 19/28 examined dogs. Nine of 28 dogs had histologically normal ceruminous glands (odds ratio [OR] 6.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-36.6). Bacterial growth in microbiological culture of aural exudate (OR 14.1, 95% CI 2.1-95.3) was associated with ceruminous glandular changes, whereas previous history of OE, cutaneous findings or underlying allergies were not. Pedigree analysis and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) were performed on 18 affected and eight unaffected dogs based on histopathological diagnosis. While the GWAS indicated a tentative, but not statistically significant, association of ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia with chromosome 31, a larger cohort is needed to confirm this preliminary result. Based on our results, ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia may also precede clinical signs of OE in ACSs and a genetic aetiological component is likely Further studies with larger cohorts are warranted to verify our preliminary results.

AB  - Otitis externa and otitis media are common in American Cocker Spaniels, however breed-specific aural CT descriptions are currently lacking. This prospective and retrospective, observational, analytical study aimed to describe quantitative CT characteristics of the horizontal ear canal and the tympanic bulla in American Cocker Spaniels versus similar-sized mesaticephalic dogs. We prospectively performed clinical examinations and aural CT scanning for 38 American Cocker Spaniels. Computed tomographic transverse area of the osseous horizontal ear canal (TA1), transverse area of the widest air-filled part of the cartilaginous horizontal ear canal (TA2), tympanic bulla volume, and tympanic bulla wall thickness were measured. The TA1 and TA2 measurements were compared with those of 23 retrospectively recruited, similar-sized mesaticephalic dogs that had undergone CT-scanning of the head for non-ear-related reasons. The TA1 and TA2 did not differ for healthy American Cocker Spaniels and mesaticephalic dogs. Severely affected American Cocker Spaniels had significantly smaller TA2 (P < .001). The intraclass correlation coefficient for intraobserver and interobserver repeatability was 0.972 and 0.983 for TA1 and 0.994 and 0.998 for TA2, respectively. Variation between individuals was subjectively noted in healthy and affected American Cocker Spaniels, but mean tympanic bulla volume was slightly smaller in relation to body weight, and the tympanic bulla wall was thicker than in previous reports for mesaticephalic dogs. The tympanic bulla wall appeared thicker rostro-ventrally than caudo-ventrally in 44% of the dogs. Our results imply that a relatively thick tympanic bulla wall may be a normal CT variation and should be interpreted cautiously in this breed.

AB  - A five-year-old female cocker spaniel was presented with left hind limb intermittent lameness after sliding one week earlier. There was no deviation of the right tarsal joint during extension and flexion of it upon a physical examination. However, there was mild pain and deviation medially on the left tarsal joint when the left tarsal joint flexed. Mild swelling of the left tarsal joint was detected upon a radiographic examination. Diagnosis was rupture of the lateral short collateral ligament (calcaneofibular ligament) of the left tarsal joint according to a physical examination. Surgical treatment was undertaken to reconstruct the lateral short collateral ligament using screws, washers and heavy suture material. The dog resumed a normal gait at nine weeks after surgery.

AB  - Background
   American Cocker Spaniels are predisposed to chronic hepatitis.
   Objective
   To describe the clinical and histological features of chronic hepatitis in Japanese American Cocker Spaniels.
   Animals
   Thirteen cases examined from 2003 to 2009.
   Methods
   Retrospective study. Medical records were searched for American Cocker Spaniels with chronic liver diseases. History, physical examination, clinicopathologic features, hepatic ultrasonographic findings, hepatic histopathology, and immunohistochemistry were evaluated.
   Results
   The median age was 4.6 (1.9-10.7) years. Clinical signs included inappetence (11/13), ascites (11/13), lethargy (9/13), diarrhea (7/13), and melena (2/13). Only 1/13 dogs was jaundiced. Clinicopathological abnormalities were increased liver enzymes (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase: 9/12, aspartate aminotransferase: 7/10, alanine aminotransferase: 6/13, alkaline phosphatase: 6/13), increased total serum bile acid concentrations (10/12), and hypoalbuminemia (10/13). The liver had an irregular surface in all dogs and acquired portosystemic collaterals were verified in 11/13 dogs by abdominal ultrasound (2), laparoscopy (4), or both (5). Liver histology revealed severe fibrosis and cirrhosis in all cases, subdivided in lobular dissecting hepatitis (7), periportal fibrosis (1), micronodular cirrhosis (3), and macronocular cirrhosis (2). Inflammatory activity was low to mild. Immunohistochemical stains showed ductular proliferation. The median survival time was 913 (range: 63-1981) days.
   Conclusion and Clinical Importance
   Hepatitis in Japanese American Cocker Spaniels is clinically silent until an advanced stage and is associated with severe hepatic fibrosis leading to cirrhosis, extensive ductular/putative hepatic progenitor cell proliferation, portal hypertension, and acquired portosystemic collateral shunting, but relatively long survival times. Lobular dissecting hepatitis seems more prevalent than in previously reported cases from other countries.

AB  - A clinical diagnosis of chronic renal failure associated with nephron atrophy and fibrosis was made in 4 blue roan Cocker Spaniels. The lesion was considered to be the result of a primary glomerulopathy. All dogs were closely related. The findings were similar to those previously described for renal cortical hypoplasia. On the basis of the morphological findings and genetic characteristics, the use of the more appropriate term, familial nephropathy is encouraged.

AB  - The results of ophthalmological examinations of 615 single-colored English Cocker Spaniels (ECS) were used for prediction of breeding values for primary cataract (CAT) and two different age-related forms of primary cataract, i.e. CAT-early and CAT-late. Breeding values (BV) for CAT, CAT-early and CAT-late were predicted using an animal threshold model and Gibbs sampling. Breeding values were then standardized onto a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 20. Relative efficiency in reducing prevalence of CAT and CAT-early were compared and we could show that selection based on relative breeding values (RBV) for CAT-early of both parents lets expect the largest relative reduction of prevalence of all forms of CATs considered here. A selection scheme based on sires or dams with RBV for CAT-early of ! 90 would have resulted in a decrease of nearly half of the population mean of 6.67% in the next generation, while a selection scheme based on sires or dams with RBV for CAT of : 90 would have resulted in a decrease of 2.2% or 3.6% of the population mean of 14.96% in the next generation. In contrast to these results, selection for CAT-late is difficult due to insufficient numbers of ophthalmologically examined dogs at higher ages. However, at the present situation the most effective selection strategy to reduce the prevalence of primary cataract in the German population of single-colored ECS would be to consider all animals affected by CAT, because differentiation in RBVs for CAT-early and CAT-late is less efficient due to the unmeaning RBV for CAT-late.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to quantify ciliary cleft parameters in the healthy eyes of American Cocker Spaniels (ACSs) and assess their correlations with intraocular pressure (TOP) using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) studies. We evaluated 26 healthy eyes from 13 ACSs. Iridocorneal angle (ICA), ciliary cleft area (CCA), ciliary cleft width (CCW), and angle-opening distance (AOD) were measured. All UBM studies were performed without pupil dilatation in both eyes of each dog. The IOPs of all eyes were measured using applanation tonometry. The mean IOP, ICA, CCA, CCW, and AOD values were 15.92 +/- 3.21 mmHg, 13.94 +/- 1.96 degrees, 0.32 +/- 0.03 mm(2), 0.33 +/- 0.06 mm, and 0.45 +/- 0.10 mm, respectively, for the entire study sample; 16.63 +/- 3.81 mmHg, 13.51 +/- 1.90 degrees, 0.32 +/- 0.02 mm(2), 0.32 +/- 0.06 mm, and 0.40 +/- 0.07 mm, respectively, in female dogs; and 14.80 +/- 1.48 mmHg, 14.63 +/- 1.96 degrees, 0.35 +/- 0.07 mm(2), 0.32 +/- 0.03 mm, and 0.53 +/- 0.09 mm, respectively, in male dogs. IOP had significant negative correlations with CCA and AOD in all eyes. There were no significant differences in IOP between male and female dogs, although there were significant differences in AOD. Our results suggest that IOP is correlated with CCA and AOD in ACSs. (C) 2018 PVJ. All rights reserved

AB  - Background: Autosomal recessive hereditary nephropathy (ARHN) in the English Cocker Spaniel is caused by a type IV collagen defect, but the underlying mutation is unknown.
   Animals: One hundred thirty-four English Cocker Spaniels (12 with ARHN, 8 obligate carriers, and 114 others), 3 mixed breed dogs with X-linked hereditary nephropathy (XLHN), and 7 other dogs without hereditary nephropathy were included.
   Methods: Diagnosis of ARHN was based on transmission electron microscopy and immunostaining of kidney. Quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to compare COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 mRNA concentrations in the renal cortex from ARHN-affected English Cocker Spaniels, XLHN-affected dogs, and dogs without hereditary nephropathy. The entire coding region of COL4A4 was sequenced in 2 ARHN-affected dogs, 2 obligate carriers, 2 English Cocker Spaniels of unknown status, and 2 healthy mixed breed dogs. The exon containing the mutation was sequenced for all 134 English Cocker Spaniels.
   Results: Quantitative real time RT-PCR implicated COL4A4 as the gene harboring the mutation, and sequencing identified a single nucleotide substitution at base 115 as the cause of ARHN in English Cocker Spaniels. This mutation, which causes a premature stop codon in exon 3 of COL4A4, was segregated with clinical status in all affected dogs and obligate carriers. The mutation also was identified in 39 of 114 other English Cocker Spaniels with previously unknown status.
   Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The cause of this disease has been identified, and use of a test for the mutation will permit eradication of ARHN in the English Cocker Spaniel.

   Cataracts are one of the most frequent ocular disorders that affects dogs and leads to blindness. In the late stages, lens opacity unables fundoscopy and consequently the diagnosis of retinal degeneration such as progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), which contraindicates surgery. Aiming the return of vision, full field electroretinogram (full field ERG) becomes indispensable before surgery. As English Cocker Spaniels are predisposed to cataracts and retinal degeneration, the objective of this study is the evaluation of the full field ERG records performed in dogs. One hundred thirty-six full field ERGs were recorded from English Cocker Spaniels (62 males and 74 females, with ages ranging from 3 to 15 years old), between September, 2004 and May, 2009. Each examined dog presented cataracts and vision loss before the exam. Diagnosis of retinal degeneration was made based on ERG parameters which were measured from peak to peak amplitude and b-wave implicit time in the 3 different responses (rod response, maximal response and cone response). Amplitude measured in rod, maximal and cone response, as well as the implicit time recorded from dogs that did not present retinal degeneration were respectively: 71.55 mu V/65.15ms; 149.17 mu V/33.03ms; and 31.06 mu V/27.90ms. No response was recorded in 38 dogs. Low responses were recorded from the remaining dogs: 12.88 mu V/65.04ms, 24.16 mu V/36.25ms, and 8.36 mu V/31.38ms. Results showed that 122 animals (89.7%) presented progressive retinal atrophy. Therefore, we conclude that full field ERG must be performed in English Cocker Spaniels presenting cataracts before its removal due to high incidence of retinal degeneration in this breed.

TI  - Low plasma taurine levels in English cocker spaniels diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy
T2  - JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE
LA  - English
AB  - Objectives The aims of this study were to evaluate taurine levels in English cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy and assess their survival time and natural progression of their disease.
   Materials and Methods Retrospective comparison of English cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype with and without taurine deficiency at the cardiology department of a UK academic referral centre between 2008 and 2018.
   Results Taurine plasma concentration was available in 16 English cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype; 13 of 16 had congestive heart failure and three of 16 did not. Taurine concentration was low (<50 mu mol/L) in 13 of 16 and normal in three of 16. Deficient dogs received taurine supplementation in addition to conventional cardiac medications. Eight dogs were still alive at the end of this study and eight were dead. MST for all dogs included in the study was 2800 days. Left ventricular systolic function improved and left ventricular dimensions reduced in English cocker spaniels with taurine deficiency following taurine supplementation and conventional cardiac therapy, although similar results were observed in English cocker spaniels with normal taurine concentration on cardiac therapy alone.
   Clinical Significance Based on laboratory reference intervals, low taurine concentrations were common in English cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy, showing a possible association between dilated cardiomyopathy in English cocker spaniels and taurine deficiency; supplementation with taurine was not curative.

AB  - An eight-week-old female Cocker Spaniel was presented with ataxia, dysmetria and intention tremor. At 16 weeks, the clinical signs did not progress. Investigation including imaging studies of the skull and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were performed. The computed tomography revealed a cyst-like dilation at the level of the fourth ventricle associated with vermal defect in the cerebellum. After euthanasia, a cerebellar hypoplasia with vermal defect was identified on necropsy. A polymerase chain reaction amplification of cerebellar tissue revealed the absence of an in utero parvoviral infection. Therefore, the cerebellar hypoplasia in this puppy was consistent with diagnosis of primary cerebellar malformation comparable to Dandy-Walker syndrome in humans.

AB  - Results of macroscopic, microscopic and electronmicroscopic investigations of two cocker spaniels with generalized ceroid-lipofuscinosis are recorded. In the nerve system, the lipofuscin granules were mainly localized, primarily in nervous cells and secondarily in glial cells of the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. Extraneuronal lipofuscin granules were found in the smooth muscle fibres (bowel, bladder, trabecles of the spleen, prostata etc.) and also in the cells of the exocrine pancreas. Electronmicroscopically the lipofuscin granules in the neurons and in the smooth muscle fibres showed the 'typical' structure of lipofuscin, whereas in macrophages and glial cells the lipofuscin appeared as fingerprint-like, pleomorphic, curvilinear and multi-membranous bodies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE
   To assess the anatomic distribution of thoracolumbar and lumbar intervertebral disk extrusions (IVDEs) in English Cocker Spaniels as compared with findings in Dachshunds and to characterize clinical findings in English Cocker Spaniels with thoracolumbar or lumbar IVDEs affecting various regions of the vertebral column.
   DESIGN
   Retrospective observational study.
   ANIMALS
   81 English Cocker Spaniels and 81 Dachshunds with IVDEs.
   PROCEDURES
   Signalment, clinical signs, neurologic examination findings, and affected inter-vertebral disk spaces (IVDSs) were recorded for both breeds. Management methods and outcomes were recorded for English Cocker Spaniels. Lesions were categorized as thoracolumbar (IVDSs T9-10 through L1-2), midlumbar (L2-3 through L4-5), or caudal lumbar (L5-6 through L7-S1).
   RESULTS
   Midlumbar and caudal lumbar IVDEs were significantly more common in English Cocker Spaniels than in Dachshunds. English Cocker Spaniels with caudal lumbar IVDEs had a longer median duration of clinical signs before evaluation and more commonly had unilateral pelvic limb lameness or spinal hyperesthesia as the predominant clinical sign than did those with IVDEs at other sites. Those with caudal lumbar IVDEs less commonly had neurologic deficits and had a higher median neurologic grade (indicating lesser severity), shorter mean postoperative hospitalization time, and faster mean time to ambulation after surgery than those with other sites affected. These variables did not differ between English Cocker Spaniels with thoracolumbar and midlumbar IVDEs.
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   Caudal and midlumbar IVDEs were more common in English Cocker Spaniels than in Dachshunds. English Cocker Spaniels with caudal lumbar IVDE had clinical signs and posttreatment responses that differed from those in dogs with midlumbar or thoracolumbar IVDE.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report the clinical findings associated with pulsus alternans in English cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy and to review the phenomenon of mechanical alternans, usually found in patients with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
   METHODS: The case records of 10 English cocker spaniels with dilated cardiomyopathy and pulsus alternans were reviewed. All dogs had been referred in moderate to severe congestive heart failure. Pulsus alternans was clinically recognised by palpation of a regular alternation of femoral pulse amplitude and confirmed by echocardiography in all cases. Pulsus alternans was an intermittent finding in all 10 dogs.
   RESULTS: Phonocardiographic recordings were obtained in three dogs to document variation in the intensity of the heart sounds, with one case exhibiting absence of the second heart sound in alternate beats. M-mode echocardiography performed in all dogs showed alternation of the pattern of mitral valve diastolic motion. Doppler echocardiography showed marked alternation in stroke volume in the aortic outflow in all cases. It also showed alternation in mitral regurgitation and in the velocity of early ventricular filling.
   CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Pulsus alternans may be more prevalent in English cocker spaniels than in other breeds, and because of its intermittent nature, its incidence may be higher than that previously reported. It has diagnostic relevance as it usually indicates severe myocardial depression. Echocardiography allows non-invasive detection of mechanical alternans and provides further insights into its pathophysiology and clinical significance.

AB  - A four-year-old cocker spaniel presented with cardiac tamponade due to a pericardial effusion, in addition to pyrexia and peripheral neutrophilia and a recent history of chest trauma. Cytological examination of the pericardial effusion revealed a predominant neutrophilia. The echocardiographic findings were of numerous hyperechoic densities in the pericardial space, due to fibrin, with concurrent thickening and distortion of the pericardium. Postmortem examination, including microbiology, revealed the presence of organising septic fibrinous pericarditis associated with a mixed infection of Streptococcus canis, Citrobacter species, Pseudomonas species and alpha-haemolytic streptococci.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ANIMAL HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION
LA  - English
AB  - An incomplete left humeral condylar fracture due to minor trauma is reported in a cocker spaniel. Because spaniel breeds are suspected of having a higher incidence of (complete) condylar fractures, medical records of all mature dogs presented to the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine (January 1979 through April 1990) with a diagnosis of humeral condylar fracture were reviewed. Fourteen of 27 humeral condylar fractures (52%) occurred as a result of minor trauma. Of the 14 minor trauma fractures, nine were cocker spaniels, two were Brittanys, and one was a springer spaniel Spaniel breeds (p=0.001) and cocker spaniels (p=0.03) were significantly predisposed to minor trauma humeral condylar fractures. No gender predisposition was noted.

CAT or CAT diagnosed in dogs up to three and a half years of age (early-onset cataract, CAT-early) and CAT diagnosed in dogs over three and a half years of age (late-onset cataract, CAT-late), PPM and DIST were included as binary traits in multivariate genetic analyses. Heritabilities on the underlying liability scale were 0.15 for CAT, 0.34 for CAT-early, 0.13 for CAT-late, 0.46 for PPM, and 0.62 for DIST in single-colored ECS and 0.06 for CAT, 0.13 for CAT-early, 0.14 for CAT-late, 0.10 for PPM, and 0.61 for DIST in multi-colored ECS. There were indications for a different genetic basis of CAT-early and CAT-late in single-colored ECS as genetic correlations were close to zero. In multi-colored ECS, a similar tendency for CAT-early and CAT-late could be observed.

TI  - INHERITANCE OF A SKULL DEFECT IN COCKER SPANIELS
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEREDITY
LA  - English
AB  - This defective skull in cocker spaniels is apparently inherited as a recessive, lethal. Since there are many puppies whelped dead in these inbred dogs there is a possibility of lethals other than the defective skull. Apparently the cleft plate is inherited, as father and son both produce it when mated to the same female, but these data plus other data which the author has, do not suggest a mode of inheritance.

TI  - INHERITED XX SEX REVERSAL IN THE COCKER SPANIEL DOG
T2  - HUMAN GENETICS
LA  - English
AB  - Nine XX true hermaphrodites and 2 XX males were discovered in a family of American cocker spaniels. The true hermaphrodites were partially-masculinized females with ovotestes; the XX males had malformed male external genitalia and cryptorchid aspermatogenic testes. Wolffian and Mullerian duct derivatives were present in both true hermaphrodites and XX males. All 4 sires of sex-reversed dogs were normal XY males; 5 of the dams were anatomically normal females and one was an XX true hermaphrodite. A 2nd true hermaphrodite reproduced as a female, producing anatomically normally offspring. All matings that produced sex-reversed offspring were consanguineous. Matings of the parents of sex-reversed cocker spaniels to normal beagles with no family history of intersexuality produced only normal offspring. Examination of G-banded karyotypes of the affected animals, their parents, and siblings, revealed no structural anomalies of the chromosomes that were consistently associated with sex-reversal. In assays for serologically-detectable H-Y antigen, the group of XX true hermaphrodites and the group of XX males had mean levels of the antigen not significantly different from that in normal male controls. Female parents of sex-reversed dogs and some of their female siblings were typed H-Y antigen positive, but the mean level of the antigen in this group was less than that of normal male controls. XX reversal in cocker spaniels may be due to a mutant gene which when homozygous in females, results in a level of H-Y antigen similar to that found in normal males and the gonads develop as ovotestes or testes. When the gene is heterozygous in females, the level of serologically-detectable H-Y antigen is lower than that found in normal males and the gonads develop as normal ovaries. The persistence of Mullerian structures in the presence of testicular tissue suggests that Mullerian inhibiting substance is deficient or ineffective in its action in this condition.

AB  - A four-years-old female cocker spaniel dog was presented with a history of vomiting and tenesmus for the last six days. There was no defecation, only fresh blood was coming from rectum and the animal was taking only a few sips of water for last two days. Physical examination revealed that the animal was dehydrated. Tenderness was appreciable on abdominal palpation while a firm, painful mass was felt in the mid-caudal abdomen. The clinical history and physical examination was suggestive of intestinal intussusception. Later on an ultrasound examination revealed a sausage-shaped mass with folded layers of intestinal wall. The intussusception was found to be ileocolic on laparotomy. Resection and end-to-end anastomosis was performed. Intussusception is commonly observed in puppies < 1 year of age, less commonly in cocker spaniels.

AB  - Renal disease affecting 3 male and 1 female English Cocker Spaniels was studied. Clinical features of the disease included proteinuria and progressive deterioration of renal function. Dogs were 11 to 27 months old when euthanized because of severe chronic renal failure. Grossly, the renal cortices were thin. Light microscopic evaluation revealed diffuse glomerular disease characterized by mesangial thickening, glomerular fibrosis, periglomerular fibrosis, and glomerular obsolescence. Based on these clinical and pathologic features, familial nephropathy of English Cocker Spaniels was suspected despite the fact that the individual dogs were not closely related. On transmission electron microscopy. a distinctive ultrastructural lesion was observed the glomerular basement membranes (GBM) of all dogs. The GBM exhibited extensive thickening, multilaminar splitting, and fragmentation. Electron dense deposits, suggestive of immunocomplex glomerular disease, were notably absent. A similar ultrastructural GEM lesion is found in human beings and Samoyeds with hereditary nephritis, diseases caused by mutations in the type IV collagen genes. Familial nephropathy in English Cocker Spaniels may be a form of hereditary nephritis caused by a mutation in one of the collagen IV genes.

AB  - A 12-year-old, spayed cocker spaniel was presented for panting behavior which had increased over the past several months. A diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism was made, and ultrasound imaging revealed the presence of a gallbladder mucocele. While often an incidental finding, gallbladder mucoceles can have consequences and require intervention. The etiology, diagnosis, and management of gallbladder mucoceles are discussed.
